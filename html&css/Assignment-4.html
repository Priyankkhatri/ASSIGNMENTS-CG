     <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The history of computers begins with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus, which was used thousands of years ago for simple calculations. 
    In the 19th century, <strong>Charles Babbage</strong> designed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <em>first true programmable computer</em>. 
    Although it was never fully built, his work inspired future inventors. 
    Ada Lovelace, often known as the <mark>first computer programmer</mark>, wrote detailed notes on how the machine could calculate numbers. 
    These early ideas were the foundation for modern computing. 
    Over time, technology advanced from gears and levers to electricity, paving the way for electronic computers. 
    This shift changed the world in ways people of the time could hardly imagine.

  <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    Computers have evolved through several <i>generations</i>, each defined by major technological changes. 
    The first generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark> which were large and unreliable. 
    The second generation introduced <em>transistors</em>, making computers smaller and faster. 
    The third generation saw the arrival of integrated circuits, while the fourth generation used <strong>microprocessors</strong>. 
    The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> became the heart of every computer, responsible for executing instructions. 
    By the fifth generation, computers started using <b>artificial intelligence</b> concepts and advanced networking. 
    Today, technology is so advanced that powerful computers fit in our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>. 
    Each generation not only improved performance but also made computers more accessible to society. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Mathematics also played a huge role in computing. 
    For example, Einstein's equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup> explained the relation between mass and energy. 
    Chemistry relies on formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>O for water or CO<sub>2</sub> for carbon dioxide. 
    Mathematical logic, with symbols and formulas, was essential in the creation of programming languages. 
    Without these equations and theories, we would not have the computing systems we use today.

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet has its roots in <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr>, developed in the 1960s. 
    It allowed researchers to share information between universities and laboratories. 
    In the late 1980s and early 1990s, <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> created the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, which made the Internet accessible to ordinary people. 
    This was one of the most important <u>inventions</u> in human history. 
    The Internet connected millions, and today billions, of people around the globe. 
    It became the foundation for email, websites, and social networks. 
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
    Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."  
    - <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>

  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p>
    In the modern world, we have moved from <del>dial-up connections</del> to <ins>broadband and fiber optics</ins>. 
    Cloud computing allows people to store and access data from anywhere. 
    Social media platforms changed communication, while online learning transformed education. 
    The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> standard is still the backbone of the web, but now it works alongside <strong>JavaScript</strong> and many modern technologies. 
    We can hold a <b>powerful computer</b> in one hand, capable of doing tasks once reserved for giant machines. 
    It is almost impossible to imagine life today without computers and the Internet.

  <h2>Computer Example</h2>
  <p>
    To display text on a webpage, you can use the following simple code:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    If you want to copy text, you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.  
    The system may respond with: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>  
    In programming, variables are often written like <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, or <var>n</var>.
